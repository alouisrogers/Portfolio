								<h2>About Me</h2>
								<p>
                                    I am currently pursuing a 4<sup>th</sup>-year Mechanical Engineering major, Computer Science minor at Northeastern
                                    University. When I am not in class or working on homework in the library, I am at the school's rocket lab 
                                    working on the next prototype of a system. I like to engage in side projects that will enhance my knowledge in 
                                    just about every field. On my limited spare time, I enjoy heading out into nature to hike in the mountains
                                    or by the ocean. The more challening the expedition, the better!

								<p>
									The challenge for this project was to build a dual deploy rocket for a Level 2 certification.
									This project was useful to be able to design a rocket airframe with aerodynamics in mind. 
									A 4:1 Tangent Ogive Nosecone and tailcone were used to reduce subsonic flow separation and a 
									tailcone was fabricated to reduce pressure drag at the aft of the rocket. To create a successful
									dual deploy system, I wired an electronics bay based on Stratologger alitmeters for deployment events,
									an Arduino for GPS and data logging, and an XBEE to trasmit the data to a ground station. 
									flight events and give telemetry data using a gps module.
								</p>
								<p> Technologies Used: XBEE GPS, Stratologger Alimeters </p>

								<p>
									I wanted a stylish bluetooth speaker with a deep sound that could hit lower end frequencies. This result is difficuly for small
									bluetooth speakers which struggle with battery and driver size due space constrictions. In order to achieve the intended result, 
									I built a speaker and determined drivers that would give the sound I wanted and a battery that would be 
									able to power it with ample battery life. The bluetooth speaker used a 3.5" subwoofer and 2" full range driver with passive filtering and 1000Hz crossover enclosed in a hardwood case. To get more depth out of the base, a port was 3d printed to let air out.
									The project resulted in a very nice looking speaker to take to beach days and to friend's houses.

							<a href="https://github.com/johnphilip283/Trash2Treasure"><h2>Audio Visualizer Speaker</h2></a>
								<p>
									The goal of this project was to create an all-in-one audio visualizer and speaker to give to my sister as a Christmas present. This was a fun quick build, which used a fully 3d printed housing and two 2" full range drivers for a good range of sound. The visualizer circuit used an arduino micro and code employing fast forrier transforms to separate the incoming audio signal into bands to be displayed on an 8x32 LED matrix, which could switch modes using a built in button. The circuit was all soldered to a perforated prototype board and code was modified from an existing arduino project. In the end, the speakers sounded good, but the visualizer seemed to have low peaks as a result of noise in the signal.

							<p>
								For my final project for my artificial intelligence class, my partner and I made a program that when given a 
								number of beams, made a truss that would be structurally stable under a given load at each connection point 
								of the structure. The problem was simplified using rigid members in two dimensions. The system was modeled 
								as a constraint satisfaction problem accelerated with a heuristic calculated from the normal equations using 
								strength increasing factors from mechanics. A Finite Element solver was used to solve for deflection and stress
								concentration of the beams to determine if the generated structure was stable or not and were drawn using the
								turtle graphics library. We were able to get some interesting structures out of the program and lots of triangles 
								which was expected.

								<p>
									I wanted to have 3d printing capability for other projects so building a 3d printer became a project in its own right. I 
									purchased a 3D printer kit from a Chinese company through Ebay. The 3d printer had to be assembled and it broke multiple times
									and parts needed to be replaced and serviced, such as the hot end assembly. Parts needed to be soldered to the control 
									board to fix shorts and code had to be updated to the most recent version of the open source Marlin 3d printer software. This project resulted in my being able to construct 3d parts for other future projects.

								<p>
									I made a challenge with a friend to build the cheapest, best gaming computer possible. This required 
									reading the specifications of each part to ensure compatibility and power requirements. I had to obtain components from multiple sources like Facebook, Ebay and local used part stores. The older generation motherboard did not have connectors for the newer case, so voltages had to be tested from the power supply and motherboard to wire and solder the necessary connections to the board and power supply to get things running smoothly. In the end, my friend ended up with a computer that can run AAA games at 60 fps for around 300$.

									I used the SDK from the leap motion controller to write a program that would open spotify and play music with the wave of a hand. The leap motion controller was not great at recognizing individual fingers so the funtionality was kept limited.

								<p>
									The rocket club needed to redesign the rocket fins for aerodynamics and understand its performance increase over the normal flat edge fins. We used Solidworks Flowsim to run simulations on a custom airfoiled rocket fin for an aerodynamic rocket build. Using batch runs and adjustable parameters, I was able to get a Force vs. Wind Velocity curve that showed the expected quadratic relationship. Using these softwares, I was able to get a design with 50% of the aerodynamic drag of the previous fin.

										<p>
											Fikst Product development is a small design firm that provides engineering consulting for companies looking to make prototypes or get an idea to market. I worked as a mechanical engineer dealing with controls systems and medical devices. I designed and made test equipment and did data analysis on the results of tests using python and excel vba.

									<p>
										Infinite Cooling is a green tech startup that makes a system to collect water vapor coming out of cooling towers to save water. I designed, built, and tested the water tight sensor enclosure running on python, which would be mounted on the system. I also built several industrial control panels for a closed loop indoor test cooling tower and one for the companies proprietary water collection system, which ran on ladder logic. Other responsibilities included designing fixtures, setting up tests for EMI interference conditions, and testing the pneumatic systems of the system.

										Displays2Go is a company that makes acrylic signage and other trade show items and office signage. My main tasks were to prototype new signage from laser cut and bent aryllic while looking at automating the process of bending and folding. I also worked on process control to maximize use of material and save money.

                                     	As a co-lead of the NASA student launch team I managed a team of five people to develop the launch vehicle and relevant documentation for the competition. I co-authored several technical documents regarding technical decisions and design processes for competition outlining the mathematics and different possibilities for each design. The project required building a proof of concept launch vehicle, the competition launch vehicle, and all the aerodynamic and structural analysis that goes into such a build.
